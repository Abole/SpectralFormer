System-specific notes
---------------------
The data were generated by Matlab R2016a or higher versions, and the codes of networks were tested using PyTorch 1.6 version (CUDA 10.1) in Python 3.7 on Ubuntu system.

How to use it?
---------------------
This toolbox consists of two proposed modules, i.e., group-wise spectral embedding (GSE: by setting band_patches larger than 1) and cross-layer adaptive fusion (CAF: by setting mode to CAF), that can be plug-and-played into both pixel-wise and patch-wise hyperspectral image classification. For more details, please refer to the paper.

Here an example experiment is given by using **Indian Pines hyperspectral data**. Directly run **demo.py** functions with different network parameter settings to produce the results. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper.

:exclamation: You may need to manually download `IndianPine.mat` to your local in the folder under path `Codes_SpectralFormer/data/`, due to their too large file size, from the following links of google drive or baiduyun:

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data, labels) and tune the parameters.

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
